# BattleFox ðŸ¦Š

A Procon replacement which aims to be not shit (tm). Pew pew.

Two parts:
- `battlefield_rcon` is the protocol implementation, it is a separate library crate, so you can use it in your own projects. Simple events listening and command sending, nothing else.
- `BattleFox` builds upon `battlefield_rcon` and will implement stuff like map vote, balancer, etc.

If you want to add BattleLog functionality (which is REST and I hate that), best way would be to make a new crate/folder inside this repo probably (similar to `battlefield_rcon`).

Very early still. Contributions very much welcome!
